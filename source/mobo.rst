Motherboards
============


General information about motherboards.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Explanation of Chipsets and Sockets. Differences in PCI-e Speeds, 3-pin and 4-pin connectors, USB 3.0 headers.. 

--> FM2, AM3+, 1150, 2011-3 (pictures)

--> H81/B85/H87/H97/Z87/Z97 Chipsets explained. Possibly a table with features. But not wikipedia sized.

--> PCI-e Gen.2 Gen.3 differences (table?)

--> Fan connctors: 3-pin fans and 4-pin fans (pictures, you can plug in 3pin in 4pin and viceversa)

--> USB 3.0 Headers. Current motherboards always have at least one of these. There are also 90Â° inverted ones (pic). These aid with keeping up the cable management and reducing the amount of clutter in your case.
