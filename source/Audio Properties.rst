Audio Solutions.

.. Hint:: Work-In-Progress. 
   Information may be missing or outright wrong.

# PC AUDIO SOLUTIONS  (Maybe remove "PC"?)

Motherboard audio: All motherboards come with an embedded soundchip. These are usually not great, but still good for the average user.

USB sound card: 

PCI-e sound card:

DAC and AMP:

Audio Interface:



-----------------------------------------------



# Important properties

Frequency range: The frequencies the speaker, headphone or (soundcard?) can (output). Usually this isn't important but audiophiles might care for this.

Frequency Response:

Impedance Rating: The resistance that the headphones' drivers (and speakers?) offer. Usually you shouldn't get a high-impedance headphone such as the DT 770 Pro that is rated at 600 Ohm (insert correct example) with a mainstream z97 motherboard, but instead with a USB DAC or AMP.
This varies greatly between motherboards, laptops and smartphones. The best way to find this out is to check at(head-fi forums? where else) (more text idk) 

Distorsion?:

Polar pattern:

"How it sounds": Studio, Bass-heavy, etc?

Sound leaking / Noise isolation


-----------------------------------------------



# Headphones (Maybe a table including pictures would be nice?)

Open-back: These headphones offer a wider soundstage (why is that good) at the cost of leaking sound and letting sourrounding's noise in.  (grammar?)

Closed-back: They offer a not-so great soundstage but they provide great sound insiluation (is this a word) and don't leak sound out. 

Semi-open: They offer good soundstages and 

On-ear: Headphones whose earpieces directly touch the listener's ears. They are usually smaller and more compact. They may be less comfortable while wearing for a long time.

Over-ear: These have bigger earpieces and sit around the listener's ears. These are usually bigger and less portable. These are usually more comfortable to wear for a long time.

Earpiece materials: Different materials, different properties: some don't make your ears sweat at all, some are less comfortable...

(Maybe something on that 7.1 headsets are bs or so and that stereo headphones are way better?)

(Table or List like mad...madcatz' one on head-fi for gaming) (and one for general music? (or is that too much(parenthesis)))

# IEM In-Ear Monitors

Types?




-----------------------------------------------



# Speakers

Configurations (Maybe with an illustration or as a table.)

2.0: Consists of two speakers that cover all frequencies. (Usually bigger?)

2.1: Consists of two speakers and a separate subwoofer. 

5.1: Consists of five (usually smaller) speakers and a subwoofer. (3d audio, dolby sorround, thx?)

7.1: Consists of seven speakers (also called sattelites) and a subwoofer. (What else?)

  

-----------------------------------------------



# Microphones

Gaming Headsets: The voice clarity is usually not that great on these. The (product 1, link to vid of mic recording) (product2, etc) are exceptions to this rule.

Modmic: A type of mic that is easily installed on most headphones. (links to 2-3 recordings, maybe pics)

Desk or Desktop mic: Mics that are usually permanently mounted on a desk. Notable examples are:... 

Pro mic:
