#Introduction to SSD's (a picture attached?)

An SSD is a flash-memory based data storing device, it is different than HDD's in that it doesn't use
a rotating disc but rather an assembly of circuits as memory to store data persistently. 

Why SSD's are better than HDD's.

Instantaneous start up. An HDD's spin-up may take several seconds whereas an SSD only needs a few 
milliseconds to come back from power saving mode.

Random access time: When you need to access data from your drive, an HDD has to wait until the 
data rotates under the read/write head. Depending on your device (PC or laptop) this may take up to 12 ms 
whereas with and SSD it is mostly under 0.1 ms.
